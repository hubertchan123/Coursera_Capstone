# IBM Capstone Project: The Battle of Neighborhoods
## Recommending prime housing locations


### 1.1 Introduction

In Singapore, the large majority of land is government-owned. Thus, most of her citizens live in public housing on leased land. The Housing and Development Board (HDB), the government agency overseeing housing development, oversees and builds the majority of new housing; these types of flats are colloquially called “HDB flats” by locals.

The HDB and private developers secure land at auctions and some higher-end housing is hence privately developed. Singapore’s public housing, or HDB flats are commonly sold to middle-income buyers and they have the right to live in their flat until the building’s 99-year lease expires. 

### 1.2 Business Problem

Land is a precious resource in Singapore, naturally, purchasing a home in the country is an important financial commitment. In this report, we will be taking up the hypothetical scenario as a local real estate agency that seeks to help middle-income buyers seek out prime housing locations in Singapore based on their preferences. Thus, the main objective of this project is to provide different housing location options based on different HDB types of residential clusters generated.

### 2. Data

This report will utilise data from the following datasets and APIs,

- https://data.gov.sg/dataset/resale-flat-prices — Resale Flat Prices on Data.gov.sg 
- https://docs.onemap.sg/ — OneMap API to obtain the geo-coordinates in Singapore, specifically, planning areas as well as HDB flats in resale dataset
- https://developer.foursquare.com/docs/places-api/ — Foursquare API will be used to explore common venues surrounding the planning area in Singapore
